### 🗺️ Land Claims & Protection (FTB Chunks)

We use FTB Chunks to ensure your homestead remains yours. Your claim grows as you spend more time on the server!

#### How to Claim Land

1. Open the Map: Press `M` to open your Fullscreen Map.
2. Claiming Mode: Click the Claimed Chunks icon (the map/grid icon) in the top left corner.
3. Select Chunks:
   * Left-Click a chunk to claim it.
   * Shift + Left-Click a chunk to Force Load it (this keeps your Cobbleworkers and machines running even when you aren't standing there!).
   * Right-Click to unclaim.

#### 📈 Expanding Your Territory

Everyone starts with a base amount of chunks, but you can earn more in three ways:

1. Playtime: You automatically gain additional claim and force-load permits the longer you play on the server.
2. In-Game Quests: Completing specific milestones in the Quest Book will grant "Claim Expansion" rewards.
3. Event Crates: Rare rewards from server events and crates can occasionally grant massive boosts to your claim limits.

#### 🤝 Group Play & Permissions

Want to build with a friend?

* Open the "My Team" settings (usually via the cog icon in the map or inventory screen).
* Invite your friends to your team to give them access to build and interact with your Cobbleworkers and machines.

### ❓ FAQ: Updated Land Claims

Q: How do I protect my house from griefing? A: Use FTB Chunks. Press `M`, click the Claimed Chunks icon, and select the areas you want to protect.

Q: Can I keep my Poké Ball factory running while I’m away? A: Yes! After claiming a chunk, Shift + Left-Click it to Force Load it. This ensures your _Create_ machines and _Cobbleworkers_ keep working while you are exploring dimensions like the _Twilight Forest_.

Q: I’ve run out of claim blocks! How do I get more? A: Keep playing! You earn them passively over time. If you need a boost, check the Quest Book for Homesteading milestones or participate in server events to win expansion permits.

Q: Someone is building too close to me. What do I do? A: While we encourage community, please respect a "Buffer Zone." If a neighbor is causing issues, contact a Moderator on Discord.
