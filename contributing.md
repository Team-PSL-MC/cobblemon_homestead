# 🌐 Easy Contributions (GitHub Web Editor)

If you want to suggest Pokémon spawn improvements, you can do it **directly in GitHub without installing Git**.

This is the **recommended method for casual contributors**.

All you need is a **GitHub account**.

---

# Step 1 — Open the Spawn Data Folder

Go to the spawn data directory in the repository:

https://github.com/Team-PSL-MC/cobblemon_homestead/tree/main/data/cobblemon/spawn_pool_world

Each Pokémon has its own configuration file.

Examples:
150-mew.json
twilight_forest_dark_forest.json
aether_village_spawns.json


Click the file for the Pokémon you want to edit.

---

# Step 2 — Click the Edit Button

In the top-right corner of the file, click the **✏️ Edit** button.

If you do not already have a fork of the repository, GitHub will automatically create one for you.

---

# Step 3 — Make Your Changes

Edit the spawn configuration.

Examples of things you might adjust:

- Spawn **weight**
- Allowed **biomes**
- **Time of day**
- **Level ranges**

Example change:

```json
"weight": 8

  Try to keep changes balanced and logical with the surrounding ecosystem.

Step 4 — Write a Commit Message

Scroll to the bottom of the page.

Write a short description of your change.

Example:

Adjusted Litwick spawn weight in Soul Sand Valley

Select:

Create a new branch for this commit

Then click:

Propose changes

Step 5 — Open the Pull Request

GitHub will take you to a Pull Request page.

Click:

Create Pull Request

Explain your change.

Example:

Adjusted Litwick spawn weight in Soul Sand Valley.

The previous weight made encounters extremely rare compared to other Ghost-type Pokémon.
This change should make Litwick encounters more consistent at night.
Step 6 — Review Process

Server staff will review your pull request and may:

Approve the change

Request adjustments

Ask questions about balance

Once approved, your change will be merged into the server configuration.

Guidelines for Spawn Changes

Please keep these guidelines in mind when contributing.

Keep Changes Reasonable

Avoid extreme spawn rates or unrealistic biome choices.

Follow Existing Formatting

Match the structure used in other spawn files.

Test if Possible

If you are able to test the spawn behavior in-game, that helps ensure the change works correctly.
