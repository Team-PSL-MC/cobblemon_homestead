## 📥 Installation & Optimization

To ensure the "dreamlike experience" the pack promises, follow these steps to install and optimize your game.

#### 1. Using the CurseForge App (Recommended)

1. Download and install the [CurseForge Launcher](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app).
2. Search for "Cobblemon Homestead" in the Minecraft section.
3. Click Install.
4. Once finished, click Play.

#### 2. Recommended Settings for Performance

Because this pack includes performance mods like Sodium, Ferrite Core, and ModernFix, it runs smoothly even on mid-range PCs. For the best experience:

* Allocated RAM: We recommend at least 6GB to 8GB of RAM. (CurseForge Settings > Minecraft > Java Settings > Allocated Memory). If you use shaders consider 8GB to 10GB of RAM.
* Video Settings: \* Entity Culling: Leave this ON to prevent lag from hidden Pokémon.
  * ImmediatelyFast: Leave this ON to boost UI and font rendering.

#### 3. Keybinds to Know

* `M` – Open the World Map.
* `R` – Send out your first Pokémon.
* `I` – Open your Sophisticated Backpack (once crafted).
* `[` and `]` – Cycle through your party members.
