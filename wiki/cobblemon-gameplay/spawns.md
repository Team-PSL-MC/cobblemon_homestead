# Spawns

## 🐾 Pokémon Spawns & World

Our world uses Moog’s Structures and Yung’s Better Revamps to create a dense, populated environment.

#### Where to Find Pokémon

Spawns in Cobblemon Homestead are biome-dependent. Here are common locations:



* Forests/Plains: Great for starters like Bulbasaur or Charmander (rare).
* Caves (Yung's Better Caves): Look for Rock and Steel types.
* Structures: Keep an eye out for custom "Cobblemon Structures" where rare loot and specific spawns occur.<br>

### Default Spawns

This is the default Cobblemon spawns. Mons might be added but nothing is removed\
