## 🏭 The Homestead Factory: Tech & Automation

While Pokémon do the hard work of harvesting, Create and AE2 handle the logistics. Below is the blueprint for a fully automated Homestead.

#### 🧩 Bridging Biology and Technology

Cobbleworkers drop items into the world or into nearby inventories. To integrate them into your tech stacks:

1. The "Chute" Method (Create): Place a worker over a Chute or Smart Chute. As they harvest crops or generate honey, the items fall directly into your belt system.
2. Vacuum Envelopes (Sophisticated Backpacks): Place a Pokémon on top of a chest with a Sophisticated Backpack (with a Magnet Upgrade) inside. It will "suck up" everything the worker drops and feed it into your storage.
3. Import Buses (AE2): Attach an Import Bus to the chest your Pokémon are filling to instantly digitize your harvest.

#### ⚡ Recommended Automation Loops

* The Poké Ball Line: Use Steel-type Workers to harvest Tumblestone $$→$$ Create Press to flatten Discs $$→$$ Mechanical Crafting to assemble balls.
* Endless Fuel: Station a Torkoal or Chandelure (Fire types) next to a Mechanical Arm. The Arm can take the generated fuel and keep your Steam Engines running forever.
* The Infinite Brewery: Use Dragon-type Workers to fuel Brewing Stands automatically while Water-types provide infinite water bottles via pipes.
