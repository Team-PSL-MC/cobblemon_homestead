# CobbleBreeding

## 🥚 Cobbreeding: The Homestead Guide

Cobbreeding brings the Pokémon breeding system to life using the Pasture Block. This system mimics the "picnic" mechanics of modern generations, allowing you to raise the next generation of powerful teammates while you focus on your farm or factory.

***

### 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to establish your first breeding ranch.

#### 1. The Pasture Block

The Pasture Block is the heart of the system.

* Placement: Place it in an open area. Pokémon assigned to the block will spawn behind it, so ensure they have at least a 5x5 area to roam.
*   Activation: Right-click the block and toggle the Breeding Button in the top right.

    > ⚠️ Note: Servers may limit how many active breeding blocks you can have at once!

#### 2. Matching Parents

Place compatible Pokémon into the Pasture Block.

* Compatibility: Parents must be of opposite genders and share at least one Egg Group.
* The Ditto Exception: Genderless Pokémon can only breed with Ditto.
* Undiscovered Group: Legendaries and "Baby" Pokémon (like Pichu) cannot breed.

#### 3. Collecting Eggs

Breeding takes time and patience.

* Harvesting: Once an egg is ready, it will appear at the base of the Pasture Block. Right-click the bottom of the block to collect it.
* Automation: You can place a Hopper or Create Chute underneath the block to harvest eggs automatically!

### 🧬 Inheritance & Mechanics

Cobbreeding follows mainline Pokémon rules with a few specific Homestead tweaks:

#### 🎭 Forms & Variants

* Regional Forms: The offspring will inherit the Mother's form. This includes regional variants (like Alolan Vulpix) and special patterns.
* Exceptions: Rotom always hatches in its base form; Flabébé hatches with a random flower color.

#### ⚡ Abilities

Hidden Abilities are easier to obtain here than in the wild:

* Mother has Standard Ability: 20% chance the baby hatches with a Hidden Ability.
* Mother has Hidden Ability: 60% chance to pass it down.
* Standard Pass-down: 80% chance to inherit the Mother's specific standard ability slot.

#### ⚔️ Egg Moves & Mirror Herbs

* Natural Passing: Offspring inherit "Egg Moves" known by either parent (including benched moves).
* Mirror Herb: If a pastured Pokémon holds a Mirror Herb, it will instantly learn Egg Moves from its pasture-mates, even if they aren't in the same Egg Group!

### ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: My Pokémon won't spawn in the pasture! A: The area is likely too cramped. Pokémon need physical space to manifest. Clear out grass, fences, or walls behind the block.

Q: My pastured Pokémon are disappearing! A: Pokémon return to the PC if they wander too far from the block. Use fences to create a designated "ranch" area to keep them within range.

Q: Does the Pasture Block work while I'm offline? A: Yes and No. The block "pauses" when the chunk is unloaded. However, when you return, it calculates the missed time and generates eggs immediately (up to its inventory limit).

> Homestead Tip: Use FTB Chunks to Force Load your ranch so it breeds 24/7!

Q: When are the stats of the baby determined? A: The Pokémon’s IVs, Nature, and Shininess are set the moment the Egg is created, not when it hatches.
