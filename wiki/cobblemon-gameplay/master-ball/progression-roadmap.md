# Progression Roadmap

### 🗺️ The Path to Mastery: A Progression Roadmap

Building a Master Ball is the ultimate goal of Cobblemon Homestead. You cannot rush it; you must progress through the world's most powerful technologies and magical dimensions. Here is the recommended order of operations.

#### 🥉 Tier 1: The Foundations (Early Game)

_Focus on mobility, basic storage, and your first Pokémon workers._

* Cobbleworkers: Catch a Scyther or Aron immediately. You need massive amounts of Iron and Copper for the machines ahead.
* The Nether: Hunt Withers. You need at least 3 Nether Stars for the final assembly.
* Exploration: Visit the Twilight Forest. You need to defeat the Ur-Ghast or explore Dark Towers to obtain Carminite.

#### 🥈 Tier 2: The Industrial Age (Mid Game)

_Focus on power generation and infrastructure._

* Create: Build a Large Steam Engine. You’ll need high Stress Capacity (SU) to run the 5x5 Mechanical Crafting Array.
* Enchantment Industry: Set up an XP farm. You need a Spout and 10,000mB of Liquid XP to infuse your first Mew Fragment.
* Industrial Foregoing: Start your Plastic production. You will need to progress to the "Supreme" tier to craft the 4 Supreme Machine Frames.

#### 🥇 Tier 3: The Digital & Mystic Frontier (Late Game)

_Focus on high-tier materials and inter-dimensional loot._

* Applied Energistics 2: Build a 128k Spatial Storage Cell. This requires a complex crystal growth setup and plenty of Quartz.
* Forbidden & Arcanus: Seek out the Eternal Stella. This often requires dark rituals or rare loot from deep underground.
* Mega Showdown: Participate in high-level raids or find meteors to secure Keystones and Wishing Stars.
* Eternal Starlight: Travel to this dimension to mine Deepsilver Ingots for the base of the ball.

#### 💎 Tier 4: The Singularity (Endgame)

_The final hurdles._

* Mekanism: This is the "Final Boss" of the tech tree. You must build a Fission Reactor and a SPS (Supercritical Phase Shifter) to produce the Antimatter Pellet.
* Legendary Hunting: You must defeat at least 3 Legendaries (or the same one multiple times) to collect the Mew Fragments.
