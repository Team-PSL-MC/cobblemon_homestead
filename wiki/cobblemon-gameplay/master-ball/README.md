# Master Ball

## 🟣 The Master Ball: A Legacy Crafted

The Master Ball cannot be found in chests or bought at the PokeMart. To obtain the ultimate catching tool, you must master technology, magic, and the dimensions themselves. This process is divided into two major phases.

### 🧪 Phase 1: The Soul Infusion

Before assembling the ball, you must prepare the "heart" of the device using a Mew Fragment.

* Source: Mew Fragments are drops from Legendary Pokémon.
* The Process: You must use a Create Spout to infuse the fragment with raw knowledge.
* Required: $$1$$ Mew Fragment + $$10,000$$ mB of Liquid Experience (from _Create Enchantment Industry_).
* Result: $$1$$ Infused Mew Fragment.

### ⚙️ Phase 2: Mechanical Assembly

Once you have your Infused Mew Fragments, you must construct a 5x5 Mechanical Crafting Array from _Create_. The precision required is immense, as it pulls resources from every corner of the world.

#### 💡 Tips for the Craft

* Powering the Array: Because a 5x5 grid requires significant Stress Capacity ($$SU$$), ensure your Create power source (Steam Engine or multiple Windmills) is robust before starting the craft.
* Automation: Use an AE2 Pattern Provider or Sophisticated Pipes to feed the ingredients into the Mechanical Crafters automatically.
* The Antimatter Bottleneck: The Antimatter Pellet is the hardest item to get. Focus on your Mekanism fission reactor early!
