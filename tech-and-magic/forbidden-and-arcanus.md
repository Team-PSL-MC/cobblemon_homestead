# Forbidden and Arcanus

### ✨ Getting Started: The First Steps

To begin your journey into the arcane, you need two fundamental tools:

1. The Mundabitur Dust: Crafted by combining Redstone, Glowstone, and a Blank Rune (or sometimes variations with Amethyst). This dust is used to "transform" blocks into functional machines.
2. The Hephaestus Forge: This is the heart of the mod.
   * Build the Base: Place a Smithing Table.
   * Transform: Right-click the Smithing Table with Mundabitur Dust to transform it into the Hephaestus Forge.

### ⚒️ How to Use the Hephaestus Forge

The Forge doesn't use coal; it uses four unique "Essences" to fuel its recipes. You can see these levels by looking at the Forge:

| Essence    | How to Get                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aureal     | Gained by wearing a Magical Orchid or standing near Aureal Clouds.     |
| Souls      | Obtained by killing mobs with a Soul Extractor in your inventory.      |
| Blood      | Gained by sacrificing mobs (killing them) on top of or near the Forge. |
| Experience | Simply right-click the Forge while you have XP levels.                 |

### 💎 Crafting the Eternal Stella

The Eternal Stella is one of the most coveted items in the game. It allows you to make any item indestructible by combining them in a Smithing Table.

#### Step 1: Gather the Ingredients

To craft it in the Hephaestus Forge, you will need:

* 3x Xpetrified Orbs (Created by smelting Xpetrified Ore or through various XP-to-Item recipes).
* 1x Stellarite Piece (Found rarely in chests or by mining Stellarite Ore deep underground).
* Aureal & Soul Essence (The Forge must be sufficiently leveled/fueled).

#### Step 2: The Ritual

1. Place the Stellarite Piece in the center slot of the Hephaestus Forge.
2. Place the Xpetrified Orbs in the surrounding slots.
3. Ensure your Aureal and Soul levels meet the recipe requirements (Check JEI for the exact numerical values as they can change based on server config).
4. The ritual will begin, and after a few seconds of particles and lightning, your Eternal Stella will appear.

### 🌙 Essential Items & Materials

As you explore the mod, keep an eye out for these resources:

* Arcane Crystal Dust: The primary "fuel" and crafting component for many blocks.
* Darkstone: Found deep in the world; used for building the high-tier magical structures.
* Edelwood: Obtained from dark forests; used to make Edelwood Buckets which can carry multiple types of liquids (even fish and souls!).
* Corrupti Dust: Used for darker rituals and creating specialized glass.

### 💡 Homestead Pro-Tips

* Infinite Tools: Once you have the Eternal Stella, apply it to your Create or Mekanism tools immediately. Never worry about durability again.
* The Master Ball: Remember, you will need an Eternal Stella for the endgame Master Ball recipe. It’s worth setting up an automated Soul and Blood farm early on.
* Aureal Tank: Craft an Aureal Tank to store your essence so you don't have to wait around the Forge for it to fill up slowly.
