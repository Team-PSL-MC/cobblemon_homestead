# League Points (LP)

## 💹 League Economy & Vendor Guide

To keep the server balanced, items in the League Shops are priced based on the effort required to clear a Frontier Gym (approx. 100–200 LP) versus a Tinker (Official) Gym (1,000+ LP).

#### 🎫 Earning Potential Reference

* Frontier Gym (Player): \~100 LP (200 LP for your first clear).
* Tinker Gym (Official): \~1,000 LP (2,000 LP for your first clear).
* Daily Limit: You can effectively earn about 500 LP per hour from a single gym before the anti-farm cap kicks in.

#### 🛡️ Anti-Exploit Rules

To keep the economy fair, the following rules are hard-coded into the League System:

* Speed-Run Protection: Gyms cleared in under 60 seconds will not grant rewards.
* Effort Check: Completions faster than 2 minutes receive reduced rewards. Take your time and enjoy the battle!
* Cooldowns: You can re-run a Player Gym every 12 hours, but Official Tinker Gyms have a 1-week (168h) cooldown.
