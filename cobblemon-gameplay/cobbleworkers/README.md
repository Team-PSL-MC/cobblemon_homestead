## 🛠️ Cobbleworkers: Automating Your Homestead

In Cobblemon Homestead, your Pokémon are more than just battle partners—they are essential workers! By using the Cobbleworkers system, you can assign your team tasks ranging from harvesting Apricorns to generating lava and scouting for rare structures.

#### ⚙️ Worker Mechanics

* Scanning Speed: Workers scan 15 blocks per tick.
* Search Range: Workers look for tasks within an 8-block radius and 5 blocks high.
* Worker Types: Most tasks are assigned to specific Pokémon species or entire Elemental Types.
