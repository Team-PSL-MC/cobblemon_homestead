# Shadow Hearts

### 🌑 What are Shadow Pokémon?

Shadow Pokémon are creatures whose emotions have been "shut out."

* Shadow Moves: They possess exclusive, powerful moves that are super-effective against all non-Shadow Pokémon.
* Closed Hearts: A Shadow Pokémon cannot gain experience, evolve, or be renamed until its heart is fully opened (Purified).
* Behavioral Issues: They may enter Hyper Mode or Reverse Mode during battle, causing them to disobey or hurt themselves.

#### ☄️ Finding Them: Shadowfall Meteoroids

Shadow Pokémon aren't just found; they are _created_. Keep an eye out for Shadowfall Meteoroids crashing into the world.

* These purple, crystalline meteors emit a corruptive aura.
* Any Pokémon wandering too close to a Meteoroid for too long may eventually be converted into a Shadow Pokémon.

### 🛠️ The Snag Machine & Aura Reader

You cannot catch a Shadow Pokémon with a standard Poké Ball if it belongs to another trainer (or if the server has specific protection).

* Aura Reader: Allows you to "see" the dark aura around Shadow Pokémon, identifying them in the wild or in a crowd.
* Snag Machine: This device "snags" Shadow Pokémon, allowing you to catch them even if they are already under the influence of dark forces.

### 🧼 The Path to Purification

To restore a Shadow Pokémon, you must empty its Heart Gauge. This can be done through several methods:

#### 1. The Call Button & Scents

* The "Call" Mechanic: During battle, if your Pokémon enters a dark state (Hyper/Reverse Mode), use the Call action to reach out to it. This calms the Pokémon and significantly lowers its Heart Gauge.
* Scents: Use special items to relax the Pokémon, gradually softening its heart.

#### 2. The Purification PC (Relive Hall)

For advanced players, the Purification PC is the fastest way to open many hearts at once. It uses two key mechanics:

* Flow: Created by placing non-Shadow Pokémon in a circle around a Shadow Pokémon. To maximize Flow, each Pokémon in the circle should have a type-advantage over the next one (clockwise).
* Tempo: The higher the Flow, the faster the "Tempo." A high Tempo dramatically accelerates the purification process while you are away or exploring.

#### 3. Relic Shrines

Once a Pokémon's Heart Gauge is completely empty, it is ready for the final step. Take it to a Relic Shrine (found in specialized structures) to perform the final ceremony. This restores its original moves, allows it to gain XP, and sometimes grants it a unique Ribbon.

#### ⚠️ Pro-Tip for Players

Purifying a Pokémon often grants it moves it couldn't normally learn in Cobblemon! It is well worth the effort to "snag" and save these creatures.
